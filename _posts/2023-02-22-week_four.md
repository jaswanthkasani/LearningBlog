In the fourth week of my Java preperation, I have covered few concepts of Object Oriented Programming such as Encapsulation, Getters and Setters, and Inheritance. 

## ENCAPSULATION ##
  In simple words, Encapsulation is wrapping up of data under single unit. It binds together the code and data it manipulates. The variables are declared private and hidden from other classes and they can be accessed through member function() of its own class in which they are declared. Encapsulation can be acheived by declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get values of a variable. Here is an example program without Encapsulation and without Encapsulation. 
  In the example program with Encapsulation, we can see that the variables are declared as private and member function() as public so that the public methods will be visible outside, using which we can set values for the variables. The public methods which are used outside the class to set values for private variables are known as **Getters and Setters**. Getters get the values and Setters set the values. When we return the value, for instance 'return name;' in getname() method, and call the method somewhere else, the value which is assigned to the variable 'name' goes to where we call the getname() method. For instance, <code> System.out.println(getname());</code>, the value of the name will be returned and printed with the help of print statement.
