In the fifth week of my Java preperation, I have studied concepts such as Super keyword, Instanceof(), Aggeregation and Method Overriding(Polymorphism). While studying these concepts, I have practiced few programs related to these concepts parallely. In this blog, I will provide a brief overview of what I have studied this week.

## Super ##
  
  Super keyword is used to call superclass methods and access the superclass constructor. If both variable names in superclass and subclass are same, super is used to refer to the variable in superclass. Super can be used to invoke the parent class method. Here is an example program of how to invoke parent class method using super. Super can also be used to invoke parent class constructor. Here is an example program of how to invoke parent class constructor using super. Note that even in subclass's constructor if we do not call super(), complier will automatically add it and call the cosntructor of the super class first. Here is an example with real use of super class constructor. Also note that if we use arguments in constructor in parent class, then while calling Super() in subclass, we should call it using the arguments provided in the super class constructor. For instance, in the previous example, it is <code> Super(id, name); </code>. When we invoke parameterized constructor explicitly, default constructor will not be invoked. Learning Super keyword was quite challenging because of its usage in different situations such as parent class method, parent class constructor and super constructor call. However, I was able to overcome these challenges by practicing appropriate programs.

## Instanceof() ##
 
  Every class is going to have a super class called ***object***. Instanceof() checks whether the object is of a particular class/Interface type. 
  Syntax:
  <code>
  (object reference variable) instanceof(class/Interface type)
  </code>
  
  We can also use <code> (object reference variable) instanceof(object) </code? because every class will have a super class by default called Object.
