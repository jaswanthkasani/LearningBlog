  I commenced learning java with the help of a website called [javatpoint]( https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial ). With the help of this website I was able to  commence my java preparation from scratch. First I started by installing intellij with the help of my udemy instructor Tim who has videos on how to install intellij for windows. Later after installation, I have created a new java class called HelloWorld and executed my first helloworld program in it. To run the file, we need to right click and select Run.
  
  Next,  I have started off with the introduction to java and its applications, JRE, JVM and JDK. JDK provides all necessary tools to develop any java application as well as run it. JDK = Tools required to develop java application + Java Runtime Environment. 
  
  Then I have learned about variables, class, objects, constructor, datatypes and type casting. Class is used to declare a class in java. Initializing an object means storing data into the object. In object-oriented programming technique, we design a program using objects and classes. An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. The syntax for class is class
  
class <className> {
  field;
  method;  
}
  
 Every variable is assigned a datatype which designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. The declaration of a variable is "datatype variablename". There are three types of variables local variables, instance variables and static variables.In general, local variables are used for temporary storage within a method, instance variables are used for object-level state, and static variables are used for class-level state. The choice of which type of variable to use depends on the specific requirements of the program and the type of information being stored.
  
  To talk about constructor, if we have a method with a class name it is known as a constructor. In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method and it is called when an instance of a class is created. This is one of the topics I found quite interesting compared to variables which is quite a bit to process in the first week of preparation. Also when I had some hard time with few topics, I have got some help from ChatGPT which generated answers which are clear and consice.
