  I commenced learning java with the help of a website called [javatpoint]( https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial ). I utilized this website to commence my Java preparation from scratch. First I started by installing intellij with the help of my udemy instructor Tim who has videos on how to install intellij for windows. After successfully installing IntelliJ, I also installed JDK and created my first Java class called "HelloWorld" and executed my first [helloworld](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/blob/main/program/helloworld.java) program in it. To run the file, we need to right click and select Run.
  
 Next, I delved into the basics of Java, including its applications, JRE, JVM, and JDK. The JDK includes all necessary tools for developing and running a Java application, and is comprised of both the required tools for Java development and the Java Runtime Environment. JDK = Tools required to develop java application + Java Runtime Environment
  
  Then I studied about variables, class, objects, constructor, datatypes and type casting. Initializing an object means storing data into the object. Object-oriented programming utilizes objects and classes to design a program, with an object being an instance of a class. An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. An advantage of creating an object is that it is going to make the program modular. The syntax for class is:

Syntax:
class <className> {
  field;
  method;  
}
  
  I learned about the different types of data that can be stored in variables, which are designated by a specific data type. Each variable is declared by stating its data type followed by its name, with the syntax being "datatype variablename". There are three types of variables local variables, instance variables and static variables. In general, local variables are used for temporary storage within a method, instance variables are used for object-level state, and static variables are used for class-level state. I have glanced through these topics and practiced few example programs of [localvariables](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/blob/main/program/localvariables.java), [instancevariables](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/blob/main/program/InstanceVariables.java) and [StaticVariables](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/blob/main/program/staticvariable.java). The choice of which type of variable to use depends on the specific requirements of the program and the type of information being stored.
  
  To talk about constructor, if we have a method with a class name it is known as a constructor. In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method and it is called when an instance of a class is created. I have used constructor in the above staticvariables example prograrm. This is one of the topics I found quite interesting compared to variables which is quite a bit to process in the first week of preparation. Also when I had some hard time with few topics, I have got some help from ChatGPT which generated answers which are clear and consice.
  
  Next, I have glanced through primitive and non-primitive datatypes. As I have prior experience with Python, I found this topic to be relatively straightforward and  I have not had a hard time going through these topics. Despite having utilized some data types in previous examples, I revisited all of them to have a comprehensive understanding.The website [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp) provided a clear and concise explanation of this topic.. Additionally, I studied type casting which is a process of converting one datatype to another. You can find an  [example](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/blob/main/program/typecasting.java) of typecasting in my github repository.
  
  In summary, I have gone through few basic concepts of java programming and installed requisite tools to practice my java programs. Moving forward, I plan to continue my journey in learning Java by focusing on object-oriented programming concepts, and I will keep updating my repository with my practice programs. This will serve as a record of my progress and allow me to reflect on what I have learned so far. Additionally, I hope that sharing my code and learning experience will be of help to others who are also just starting out on their Java programming journey.
