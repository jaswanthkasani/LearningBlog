I would like to choose JAVA as my new learning language for this semester. Java has always been in demand in the software industry because of its ability to create mobile/web applications and it is an object oriented programming language and has many features such as interfaces, classes. Learning JAVA adds weight to my technical skillset. It's easy to understand other programming languages such as c and c++ once we master JAVA. Also, I will have more career opportunities in the future as a full stack developer.
