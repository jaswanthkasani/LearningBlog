The new programming language I would like to learn this semester is JAVA. Java has always been in demand in the software industry because of its ability to create mobile/web applications and portability. Learning JAVA adds weight to my technical skillset. It's easy to understand other programming languages such as c and c++ once we master JAVA. Also, I will have more career opportunities in the future as a full stack developer.
