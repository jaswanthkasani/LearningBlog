In the second week of my java preperation, I have studied concepts of control flow statements such as if statements, switch statements, do while loop
while loop, for loop, for-each loop, break statement and continue statement. After briefing through these concepts I have practiced few programs regarding these concepts. Here are few [programs](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/tree/main/program/control%20Statements) regarding control statements. In the begining, I have faced challenges while practicing these programs because in python we do not use curly braces like we use in java, we use indentation.
So, while practicing these programs, I have faced errors due to not providing curly braces at the begining and at the end of the statements.
Basic syntax of if-else :
<code>
if(condition){
//statement
}
else{
//statement
}
</code>

Unlike python java has switch case statement. If the expression matches with case-1, all the statements from case-1 will be executed.  Here is an example program of [switch](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/blob/main/program/control%20Statements/switch.java) case statement. Also, if we want only one statement to be executed which is associated with that case, use (break) after that statement which will hinder the program from execiting further.

Next, I have gone through few concepts of Object Oriented Programming such as Class, Object, Method, Constructor. A class is a blue print of an object. Anything that you want to represent in a computer (a real world object), in java you are going to write it as an object. A method is a way to carry out a task. A method is a group of statements or a block of code that performs a specific task or operation. It is used to achieve code reusability. We create a method once and use it numerous times. The advantage of writing an object is that it is going to make the program modular (You are clearly seperating out a part of it as an entity). When we have such modularity in program, it will be easier to write and read it. For instance, if we have a class named Dog, this is how we create an object for that class in the main method.
<code>
  Dog d1 = new Dog();
  </code>

After going through class and object, I have studied the concept of constructors. Constructors are declared inside a class as a method with class name. There are three types of constructors. Default constructors, No-arg Constructors and parameterized constructors. In parameterized constructors, we pass arguments to the parameters initialized in constructor through objects. Here is an [example](https://github.com/jaswanthkasani/LearningBlog/blob/main/program/parameterizedconstructors.java) of parameterized constructor.

This has been a pretty busy week for me, so I have limited my preparation to only a few concepts. Beginning next week, I will delve deeply into the concepts of Object oriented programming in Java.
